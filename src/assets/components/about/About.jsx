            <p>Hi there! I am Amar Murmu, and I am a Graphic designer, Web developer & 3D artist with over 2 years of experience. I have a Diploma's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Silli Polytechnic, Ranchi. <br />

I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from simple portfolio to full-stack ecommerce projects and many more. I am skilled in Blender, C, C++ & Java programming language, Audacity for sound designing, Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator for UI/UX & graphics, and Capcut & Canva for video editing. Currently, I am learning React.js.

<br />

I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to create innovative and engaging Web designs, and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

<br />When any client hires me my only goal is to solve their problem with the best practical solution and delivering the best quality product.</p>
